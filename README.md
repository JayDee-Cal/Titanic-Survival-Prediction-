Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning - Logistic Regression


Importing Libraries
In this project, I import essential libraries that play pivotal roles in enhancing data manipulation and visualization capabilities:

pandas: A versatile library for data manipulation and analysis, enabling me to handle tabular data structures effectively.
numpy: A fundamental library for numerical operations and computations, empowering me with efficient mathematical operations on arrays.
seaborn: A powerful data visualization library based on matplotlib, simplifying the creation of informative statistical graphics.
matplotlib.pyplot: A widely used library for creating plots and charts, crucial for visualizing my data and analysis results effectively.
Loading Data
My project begins with loading data from CSV files using the pandas library, segregating the data into train and test datasets. 
These datasets contain crucial information about the Titanic passengers, forming the foundation of my analysis.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Engaging in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I embark on a journey of understanding my dataset deeply. Through various visualization techniques.

Explore relationships between different variables, potentially revealing correlations that could impact survival predictions.
Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a pivotal stage in my analysis. 

Address missing values meticulously, strategically choosing methods like imputation to fill in the gaps in my data.
Drop irrelevant columns such as "PassengerId," "Cabin," "Name," and "Ticket," which don't significantly contribute to my analysis.
Engage in feature engineering, crafting new features or transforming existing ones to enrich my dataset. This can lead to improved predictive performance.
Model Testing
My project involves rigorous model testing to determine the best approach for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. I chose machine learning model - Logistic Regression. 

Conclusion
At a predictive accuracy of 78 %, my model demonstrates its potential to forecast Titanic passenger survival effectively. 
This project not only illustrates the practical application of machine learning techniques on historical data but also provides insights into the influential factors 
behind survival rates during the Titanic disaster.
